# Data-Science-Sprint-2025

Welcome to the **Data-Science-Sprint-2025** repository!  
This project is designed as a comprehensive, hands-on sprint for data science learners and practitioners to sharpen their skills in data analysis, machine learning, and related tools throughout 2025.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains code, datasets, notebooks, and resources for a series of data science challenges and learning modules. The sprint covers a broad spectrum of data science tasks, including but not limited to:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and evaluation (regression, classification, clustering, etc.)
- Visualization and reporting
- Deployment and reproducibility

- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

### Installation

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jeevaklonare01/Data-Science-Sprint-2025.git
   cd Data-Science-Sprint-2025
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **(Optional) Launch Jupyter Notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## 💡 How to Use

- Browse the `notebooks/` directory for interactive learning modules.
- Scripts for data processing and model training are in `scripts/`.
- Place datasets in the `data/` folder as required by each challenge/module.
- Check `results/` for output files after running scripts or notebooks.
